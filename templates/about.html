<p>
This website is a personal project created to make learning Finnish vocabulary clearer,
better structured, and more enjoyable. It aims to combine dictionary-quality information
with interactive tools for studying words in meaningful ways.
</p>

<h3>What the site offers</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Word meanings</strong> with multiple translations</li>
    <li><strong>Topic categories</strong> and subcategories that organize vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Level filtering</strong> to focus on easier or more advanced vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive views</strong>: table, card view, and flashcards</li>
    <li><strong>Example sentences</strong> with English translations <em> (coming soon) </em></li>
    <li><strong>Word and meaning relations</strong> such as synonyms or shared roots <em>(coming soon)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>The level system</h3>
<p>
Every word is assigned a difficulty level from <strong>1 to 5</strong> (plus “+” for unranked or special items).
These levels are not official CEFR levels — they are a personal heuristic to help structure learning:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Very common, essential beginner vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Basic everyday words</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Intermediate vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Level 4:</strong> Less common or more specific words</li>
    <li><strong>Level 5:</strong> Advanced, formal, or abstract vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Level +:</strong> Words without a defined level yet</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can filter any page by level, and this selection stays consistent as you navigate.
</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>
<p>
Most basic definitions and translations originate from
<strong>Wiktionary</strong>.  
Wiktionary content is licensed under <em>CC BY-SA 4.0</em>, so this project may reuse and adapt it with attribution.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
This project continues to evolve, and features such as improved flashcards,
more examples, some grammar and smarter search are planned for the future.
