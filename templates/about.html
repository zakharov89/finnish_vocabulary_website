<p>
<strong>Work in progress.</strong> This website is a personal project to make learning Finnish vocabulary clearer,
better structured, and more enjoyable. It combines dictionary-style information with authentic usage data,
including example sentences and common word combinations drawn from real Finnish subtitle material
(such as films and TV series).
</p>


<h3>What the site offers</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Word meanings</strong> with multiple translations (where available)</li>
    <li><strong>Topic categories</strong> and subcategories for organizing vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Level filtering</strong> to focus on easier or more advanced vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive study views</strong>: table, card view, and flashcards</li>
    <li><strong>Example sentences</strong> with English translations <em>(in progress)</em></li>
    <li><strong>Word relationships</strong> (e.g. related meanings, variants, shared roots) <em>(in progress)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>The level system</h3>
<p>
Every word is assigned a difficulty level from <strong>1 to 5</strong> (plus “+” for unranked or special items).
These levels are not official CEFR levels — they are a personal heuristic intended to help structure learning:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Very common, essential beginner vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Basic everyday words</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Intermediate vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Level 4:</strong> Less common or more specific words</li>
    <li><strong>Level 5:</strong> Advanced, formal, or abstract vocabulary</li>
    <li><strong>Level +:</strong> Not ranked yet</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can filter pages by level, and the selection stays consistent as you navigate.
</p>

<h3>Data sources & attribution</h3>
<p>
Many basic definitions and translations originate from <strong>Wiktionary</strong>.
Wiktionary content is licensed under <em>CC BY-SA 4.0</em>, so this project may reuse and adapt it with attribution.
Other content (such as curation, organization, and some examples) is added as part of this project.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
This project is evolving continuously. Some parts of the vocabulary set and example coverage are still limited,
and the site may change as new features are added.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Admin edits affect the live database and may not be reflected in the public repository.</li>
    <li>Feedback and suggestions are welcome.</li>
</ul>
